# BuilderGen 0.2

## Intro
BuilderGen uses [APT](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/apt/index.html) and [CodeModel](http://codemodel.java.net/) to generate builders at compile time. The builders implement Josh Bloch's Builder Pattern from [Effective Java](http://java.sun.com/docs/books/effective/).

If you wonder how it actually works, read the dedicated [wiki page](https://github.com/pyricau/BuilderGen/wiki/How it works).

## 3 simple steps

* Configure your project to use BuilderGen annotation processing. Instructions [in the wiki](https://github.com/pyricau/BuilderGen/wiki).
* Add ```@Buildable``` to any class you wish.
* A builder is automatically created for this class.

## Code example

Suppose you have a Person class:

```java
@Buildable
public class Person {

    private final int age;
    private final String name;

    Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    // [...]
}
```

BuilderGen automatically generates a PersonBuilder, and you can now do the following: 

```java
PersonBuilder builder = PersonBuilder.create();
Person john42 = builder.name("John Smith").age(42).build();
Person john69 = builder.age(69).build();
```

## Generated code

Have a look at the nicely generated PersonBuilder code :

/**
 * Builder for the {@link Person } class.<br />
 * <br />
 * This builder implements Joshua Bloch's builder pattern, to let you create {@link Person } instances 
 * without having to deal with complex constructor parameters.
 * It has a fluid interface, which mean you can chain calls to its methods.<br />
 * <br />
 * You can create a new {@link PersonBuilder } instance by calling the {@link #create()} static method, 
 * or its constructor directly.<br />
 * <br />
 * When done with settings fields, you can create {@link Person } instances 
 * by calling the {@link #build()} method.
 * Each call will return a new instance.<br />
 * <br />
 * You can call setters multiple times, and use this builder as an object template.
